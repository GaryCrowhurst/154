                    correctAnswer: 2,
                    explanation: "Steering geometry includes castor angle, camber angle, kingpin/swivel pin inclination, wheel/rim offset, and wheel alignment (tracking), but not 'cylinder offset' which is not a standard steering geometry term."

                    correctAnswer: 2,
                    explanation: "The Ackerman principle relates to steering geometry during turns, where the inner wheel turns at a greater angle than the outer wheel to follow the correct turning radius."

                    correctAnswer: 2,
                    explanation: "While modern power steering systems may incorporate ECUs, a traditional hydraulic power steering system consists of piston and power cylinders, drive belts and pumps, hydraulic valves, and hydraulic fluid, but not necessarily an ECU."

                    correctAnswer: 2,
                    explanation: "Excessive positive camber (when the top of the wheel tilts outward) causes wear on the outer edge of the tyre."

                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "Oversteer is when a vehicle turns more sharply than intended, often causing the rear end to slide outward during cornering."

                    correctAnswer: 3,
                    explanation: "Toe out on turns refers to the geometry where the inner wheel turns at a greater angle than the outer wheel when cornering, allowing each wheel to follow its correct turning radius."

                    correctAnswer: 0,
                    explanation: "Understeer occurs when a vehicle turns less than expected for a given steering input, typically causing the front end to push toward the outside of the turn."
